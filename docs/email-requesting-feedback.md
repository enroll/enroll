Friends,

Shay, Nick and I are working on a system to make it easier for people to market, manage and sell tickets for short courses, such as workshops.  We were frustrated with the hodgepodge solutions available: instructors are forced to cobble together an event ticketing system with a separate marketing site and homegrown social media promotion tools.  And don't even start on the course management tools out there.

There simply is no one stop solution that allows teachers to simply teach, while facilitating an awesome teaching and learning experience.  We believe with better tools available, more people will be able to share their knowledge through short courses and workshops, and generate extra income in the process.

So here we go.  We're building it.

Where do you come in?  You're a teacher.  You've taught a workshop or a class or spoken at a local user group.  You know the pain of trying to promote and organize and market and ticket.  Creating the course materials is hard enough!  We're building this system for you.  We'd love to hear what would make your life easier.

We've already built a prototype of the marketing site builder.  Our goals is that it should take you less than 10 minutes to build your site promoting your course.  You can check out our demo here: http://workshop-platform.herokuapp.com

We've got a lot of other exciting features planned.  Frankly, there are so many, we're not sure where to start!  Take a look at some of our ideas below or at the bottom of the demo and do one of three things:

1. Give me (Jess) a call and tell me what you think: **979-215-6777**.  Seriously, I'd love to hear from you.
2. Email us your thoughts, criticisms, and requests.  We want this system to make your life easier.
3. [Pass the demo on](mailto:jessmartin@gmail.com,subject?) to someone you think might like to use it.

We're busy little bees building this tool.  We're hoping to launch the basic toolset soon, and we think it will already be head-and-shoulders better than anything you've used yet.  If you'd like to keep receiving updates as we build, add your email here: http://workshop-platform.herokuapp.com/demo
