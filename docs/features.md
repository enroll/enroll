### Product Story

Mike knows Ruby really well, and has a decent gig in town working for a local consultancy.  However, he wants to make a little cash on the side and make a name for himself.  He decides he'll run a 4-day workshop in the evenings at the local coworking space and teach Ruby.  He needs to spend most of his time building his slide decks and planning the curriculum, but he also needs to promote the workshop and get people to sign up and pay him.

Enter Workshop Platform!  Mike surfs over to Workshop Platform.  Without signing up, he's able to enter a few details about his workshopâ€“time and dates, location, topics, information about him as an instructor.  He chooses a few visual details, and then immediately he previews his custom created workshop page.  He takes a little screenshot tour of the backend course and ticketing management functions, and then decides to go for it.  They want a few percentage points of his ticket sales, but they'll save him a ton of time building a website to promote his workshop, so he gladly signs up and his workshop page is instantly live.

Over the next few weeks, he promotes his workshop site via Facebook, twitter, and local user groups and gets a lot of traffic to his workshop page.  He decides to purchase a custom domain to make his site stand out a little more and capture some Google pagerank magic.  It's a quick one-click setup on the workshop platform to activate his new custom domain name.

As the week approaches for his workshop, he gets notification emails for each signup as they sign up and pay.  Exciting!  He's making money already!

The week of the workshop comes and his students get emailed an invite to access the course materials on the workshop platform.  Mike posts an announcement for students to make sure they have a certain version of Ruby installed prior to the first night of the workshop.

The workshop platform has a simple Q&A piece where they can ask Mike questions.  Students ask a few questions that Mike hadn't thought of.  Do I need to read any books before coming?  Are you going to cover this-or-that topic?  Mike is able to communicate with them prior to them showing up at class and other students are able to see the questions and answers, thus relieving Mike of the burden of answering the questions multiple times.

Students can see who else is signed up for the workshop and a few of them contact each other and work out rides from downtown to the coworking location.

The workshop goes off really well!  Mike is nervous the first night, but each night he gains confidence in his speaking and the material.  The students really enjoy learning from him and from each other.

After the workshop, Mike kicks off the "improve your workshop fu" feature of the workshop platform which sends an email out to all of the students requesting feedback on how well the workshop was run and the opportunity to offer anonymous feedback for Mike if so desired.  A few of the students give great constructive feedback for Mike, but most of the just take a few seconds to click a few numbers between 1 and 10.  Still, useful.

A few weeks go by and Mike starts thinking.  Maybe I should do that again?  It was fun, he made money, and even made a few friends.  And what do ya know, he gets an email from the Workshop Platform, asking if he'd like to set up another version of the class.  He clicks the link and is guided through a simple interface asking him to update any of the workshop info and enter new dates and locations.  He also sees the feedback from the previous students and is able to automatically add a testimonials section to his new workshop site.  He sees the students questions from the Q&A tool and is easily able to add an FAQ section to the site.

When he's done creating the new workshop site, he sees he has a link to the old workshop, and the new site looks even more convincing and fully fleshed out than the past one.

Wow, this workshop platform makes is really easy for Mike to make money doing what Mike does best: teach his stuff!
